      <h1>L = Lions</h1>
<p>Lions are leaders. They are usually the bosses at work... or at least they think they are! They are decisive, bottom line folks who are observers,
not watchers or listeners. They love to solve problems. They are usually individualists who love to seek new adventures and opportunities.
<br>
<br>
Lions are very confident and self-reliant. In a group setting, if no one else instantly takes charge, the Lion will.
Unfortunately, if they don't learn how to tone down their aggressiveness, their natural dominating traits can cause problems with others.
Most enterpreneurs are strong lions, or at least have a lot of lion in them.

<h1>B = Beavers</h1>
